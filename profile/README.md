# Code @ KWLT

This is the GitHub organization for the Kitchener-Waterloo Little Theatre, located in Ontario, Canada.  We are a 100% volunteer run orgainization.  Some of our volunteers have created software projects for use at the theatre, and this is our home for those projects.  For other projects which don't fit neatly into `git` please see the "Code @ KWLT" Guide in the KWLT Google Drive.

## Contributing

To become a member of this organization, please contact our Secretary or Webmaster.  Just like the Slack, please join with your personal account rather than any @KWLT account of which you are the current steward.  For those of us with both, we only commit code as our personal selves; the @KWLT GitHub account is for administrative purposes only (like writing an Organization ReadME ðŸ˜‰).
